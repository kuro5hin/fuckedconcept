Fucked Concept
=============

The website fuckedconcept.com is a pretty simple little one-page web toy, that pulls words from a tumblr (http://tumblr.fuckedconcept.com/) and animated gifs from Giphy (http://giphy.com/) and puts them together in the page. This here is the site's html, css and javascript in case anyone wants to derive any new sites from it or add any features to FC itself. 

The license is the MIT do whatever you want license.

FC is the result of a Twitter conversation between Rusty Foster,  Paul Ford, Elizabeth Lopatto, and Leah Reich. All of us contribute words to the Tumblr, the code is by Rusty.
